---0:
exercise of memory 1: fill the {holes}
every question starts with one line in the form:

\---[points]:

where the points is the points of the user in
the question. At the effect of to start a new file,
the given line can be put as such:

\---0:

but it could be any value between 0 and 1 inclusive

afterwards the user writes the question itself, with
the holes between \{, \} as such:

\---0:
a b \{c\} d

that when the file is written it will go like this:
a b {c} d

with a solution "c".
afterwards continue to the next question, start with:

\---0:
and afterwards the question:

\---0:
a b \{c\} d
\---0:
1 2 3 \{4\}

at the end of the last question close the list with a

\---end
as such:


\---0:
a b \{c\} d
\---0:
1 2 3 \{4\}
\---fin

to see how the example comes out, the reader can:
a - write "holes" in the square of input at the start of this page and then go to the link "continue" below

or,

b - go to the link above "to the start"	and in the selection of files choose "example_of_the_tutorial.rlh"

or,

c - in the place of the file of the last alternative, the reader can try their own file of questions in the format that has been explained

or do all the methods at the same time etc...
---0:
a b {c} d
---0:
after to play an exercise, at termination, to save
the new points, go to the link "save" above and
if desired, overwrite the current questions arvchive. This will update the points.

note: to include symbols that have special significance to the progra, they are \{, \} and lines of the form:

\---end

or

\---0.123:

where the "0.123" is any points, enter immediately in the front a '\\' without to leave any spaces in between, as such:

\\\{

\\\}

\\---end

\\---0.123:

to exit, go to the link "exit" that is found above.
